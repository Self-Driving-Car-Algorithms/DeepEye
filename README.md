This research project will demonstrate how a vision-based system can be utilized
for scene understanding when sensor-based systems are not available for
autonomous driving. Our project aims to successfully build, then evaluate a vision-based
scene recognition model that classifies and accurately estimates the
distances and trajectories of relevant objects surrounding a driving
agent. The system would analyze the scene and perform both 3D
localization and image segmentation, then alert the driver if any of the
objects pose a potential threat through vocal warnings. We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Titan Xp GPU used for this research.
