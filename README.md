This research project demonstrates a computer vision-based Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Our project aims to successfully build, then evaluate a vision-based scene recognition model that classifies relevant objects surrounding a driving agent, and accurately estimates whether the driver is staying in lane or not. The system would analyze the scene, then alert the driver if any of the objects pose a potential threat through the dashboard (warning interface). We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Titan Xp GPU used for this research.
