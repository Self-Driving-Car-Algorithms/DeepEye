This research project will demonstrate a computer vision-based Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Our project aims to successfully build, then evaluate a scene recognition model that detects and classifies relevant objects surrounding a driving agent. The system would analyze the scene, then alert the driver if any of the objects pose a potential threat. We gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of the Titan Xp GPU used for this research.
